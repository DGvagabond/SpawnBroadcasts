# SpawnBroadcasts
A simple plugin thrown together by request that allows server owners to configure broadcasts that happen whenever a player spawns in. Each role can be configured to have their own specific broadcast. By default, all settings are disabled to ensure you visit this documentation before use.

To disable a specific role's spawn broadcast, just leave the setting blank, just like the following defaults:

| Config Setting | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| is_enabled | bool | false |
| class_d | string | null |
| chaos_insurgency | string | null |
| scientist | string | null |
| facility_guard | string | null |
| mtf_cadet | string | null |
| mtf_lieutenant | string | null |
| mtf_scientist | string | null |
| mtf_commander | string | null |
| scp_049 | string | null |
| scp_0492 | string | null |
| scp_079 | string | null |
| scp_096 | string | null |
| scp_106 | string | null |
| scp_173 | string | null |
